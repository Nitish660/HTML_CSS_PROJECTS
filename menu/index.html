                                    <li>STEP 1</li>
                                    <p>To make the syrup, gently heat the cardamom, sugar and 500ml water in a saucepan.
                                        Don't let the water boil before the sugar has dissolved. Simmer for 10 mins,
                                        then
                                        cool.</p>
                                    <li>STEP 2</li>
                                    <p>Gradually add the rosewater, saffron and a little of its soaking liquid until you
                                        have a subtly flavoured syrup. Set aside.</p>
                                    <li>STEP 3</li>
                                    <p>To make the gulab jamun, use a pestle and mortar to grind together the cardamom
                                        and
                                        sugar until fine.</p>
                                    <li>STEP 4</li>
                                    <p>Sieve the milk powder, flour and baking powder into a mixing bowl and stir in the
                                        cardamom and sugar mixture. Rub in the 50g ghee or butter using your fingertips
                                        until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</p>
                                    <li>STEP 5</li>
                                    <p>Add the yogurt, lemon juice and enough milk to form a soft dough, taking care not
                                        to
                                        overwork the mixture.</p>
                                    <li>STEP 6</li>
                                    <p>Oil your hands with a little sunflower oil and shape small portions of the dough
                                        into
                                        walnut-sized balls, about 3cm in diameter and 20g each. Make sure the dumplings
                                        are
                                        smooth and have no cracks or folds.</p>
                                    <li>STEP 7</li>
                                    <p>Reheat the syrup until it comes to the boil, then turn off the heat and cover
                                        with a
                                        lid.</p>
                                    <li>STEP 8</li>
                                    <p>Heat the 1kg ghee in a wok or karahi to 130C or until a small piece of dough
                                        dropped
                                        in turns golden in 40 seconds. Fry the balls, in batches, over a medium heat for
                                        5-7
                                        mins, moving them around until they are an even, deep brown. Remove from the
                                        saucepan using a slotted spoon, then drain on kitchen paper. Add to the warm
                                        syrup,
                                        leaving them to soak for 2-3 hrs or preferably overnight.</p>
                                    <li>STEP 9</li>
                                    <p>When ready to eat, warm the gulab jamun through in a wide saucepan, spooning over
                                        the
                                        syrup. Serve piping hot with the pistachios scattered over.</p>
